<h1>Natural Disaster Survival Script - Auto Win, Teleport, More</h1>

In Natural Disaster Survival, players scramble to find shelter as hurricanes or thunderstorms approach, though conventional hiding spots often prove deadly—like the collapsing school building that crushes those who stay indoors. Survival hinges on fleeing into open areas rather than seeking refuge in seemingly secure corners, as many mistakenly do, only to be buried in debris when the storm intensifies. The game’s mechanics, including Auto Win, No Fall Damage, Vote Map, Rainbow Ocean, and Teleports, offer strategic advantages, enabling players to navigate chaotic scenarios more effectively while emphasizing the counterintuitive tactics required to outlast disasters.
